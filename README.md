# Compositional_Numerical_Reasoning

Training RNNs to learn the compositional structure of addition sequences.

## Experiment 1: Systematicity - generalisation to novel simple addition sequences
### Exp1_Simple_Addition.ipynb
Trains sets of RNNs on increasing numbers of simple addition sequences.
### Exp1_Representational_Geometry.ipynb
Visualises the hidden layer representational geometry.
### Exp1_Control_Models.ipynb
Calculates variance of RNN RDM explained by control models.

## Experiment 2: Productivity - generalisation to longer complex addition sequences
### Exp2_Complex_Addition.ipynb
Performance of simple addition trained RNNs on complex addition sequences. Visualises performance and hidden layer geometry.
